# test-public
A public page allows making GitHub Pages for the repository from a free account.

Now that it has been configured in the repository settings, you can find this repo's page at https://matthews-intl.github.io/test-public/.

A promising use-case of these pages is a private python package repository, like the one implemented at https://github.com/astariul/github-hosted-pypi. To make a page such as this private, we will have to upgrade to an Enterprise account.
